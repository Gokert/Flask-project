### Recruiting
A certain company is recruiting for vacant positions. A recruiter can create a portfolio, view open vacancies and register for interviews. In his personal account, he is given the opportunity to monitor his application and the results of the interview.
Company officials keep track of incoming applications, and schedule interviews for recruiters, specifying the date and appointing the employee who will interview the recruiter.
Administrators edit data about employees and add new ones.
